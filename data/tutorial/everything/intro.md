# Introduction

Welcome to your first lesson from `better`! The goals for this lesson are to first get
familiar with using the command line, then to learn how to use the `better` command to
continue learning new things.

## A brief warning

The first thing you must realize is that the command line is not something to be scared
of, or that you should be avoiding---it is simply one of the tools that we, as computer
users, have at our disposal to get the computer to do what we want it to do. While it is
certainly possible for you to *seriously mess up your computer* when working with the
command line, if you follow these simple rules, you will never experience much trouble:

1.  __Never__ run a command before you know what it does. It's pretty easy to look up the
    command you are running in the manual or online. We'll go over the manual shortly.
2.  __Never__ run an unknown command from an untrusted source. Untrusted sources include:
    *   Random people you meet on the street
    *   Typing things in randomly to see what you can find
    *   The Internet, when not properly supported

In normal usage of the command line, there is pretty much no chance you will be able to
accidentally do anything harmful. So long as you remain knowledgeable about the commands
you are running, you will have nothing to worry about.

## Running commands

With that out of the way, let's be on with it. You've already run (at least) one command
to start this lesson: `better learn everything`. Let's go over exactly what you did:

1.  The first thing you did was open the __terminal__, which presented you with the
    __prompt__. The prompt contains some information (which you don't need to trouble
    yourself with for now) and usually ends with a `$`. After the `$` is where you are
    allowed to type __commands__.
2.  Next, you typed a command, which in this case was the three words: `better learn everything`

    *   The first word of every command is the name of the *program* that you want to run.
        There are  lots of programs available to you, no different than the programs you
        have certainly used before, including your web browser, media player, and the
        terminal you are reading from right now.
    *   The rest of the words are *arguments* or *parameters*. The program receives these
        arguments, and uses them to figure out what you want it to do.

3.  The last thing you did was press the `<enter>` key. Only when you press `<enter>`
    does the command actually get sent to the computer, but once you submit it, there's no
    going back.

In this particular case, you ran the program called `better`, with the arguments
`learn everything`. When you pressed `<enter>`, the `better` program started running, looked
at the arguments, and presented you this message.
